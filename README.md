# Weather_determine
A simple weather web app that shows real-time weather and local time for any city. Built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It uses the Open-Meteo API for weather data and geocoding, and a timezone API to display the local time based on the cityâ€™s coordinates. No API key required.
